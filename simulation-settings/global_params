-Wimplicit -Wportbind
-n

This file specifies extra parameters to give to iverilog (the simulation
compiler), vvp (the simulation engine), and gtkwave (the wave output viewer).
The first line specifies parameters to iverilog, the second line for vvp, and
the third line for gtkwave. All lines after the third are ignored.
Usage tips:
  iverilog:
    Use this to specify extra libraries or modify the warnings that appear.
    Warnings of interest are -Wimplicit for implicit declarations of wires,
    and -Wportbind for unconnected ports in module instantiations.
    See the iverilog man page (man iverilog) for more information.
  vvp:
    Use this to choose between non-interactive mode (-n), partially-interactive
    mode ($stop will drop to a command prompt), and fully-interactive mode (-s).
    See the vvp man page (man vvp) for more information.
  gtkwave:
    Use this to specify start (-s) and end (-e) times if your testbench only has
    a limited interesting range and you want to speed up gtkwave (or make it
    easier to find the interesting parts). You can also enable the slider
    stretch zoom feature for the horizontal time slider using -z.
    See the gtkwave man page (man gtkwave) for more information.
